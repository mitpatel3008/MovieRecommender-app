## 🎬 Movie Recommender System (Content-Based)

This project is a content-based movie recommender system that suggests movies similar to a user’s favorite film by analyzing metadata—such as genres, cast, and crew. It uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to deliver accurate recommendations.
